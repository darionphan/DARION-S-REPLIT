**Summary**
The project Ranju and I chose to do was to learn the coding language R. We primarily used Codecademy as the jumping off point then branched
off from there. The dataset we chose to analyze was the highest daily temperature of each day in Oakland, California to see if we could
find trends in the data. We depicted the data using multiple different plots. An example of what we used was the histogram, box-and-whisker
plot, etc. The documentation can be found here for this histogram. This website contains the documentation for the other graphs as well.
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/hist. Our demo application is on repl.it because Darion had
difficulties using RStudio. It is linked here on the Github Repository https://github.com/darionphan/DARION-S-REPLIT. 
It is also linked on repl.it https://repl.it/join/xjwykunu-darionphan.

**Proposed Tool or tools**

The language R. https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-r/lessons/introduction-to-r/exercises/why-r.

**Ideas for demo application**

Manipulating values from data and creating charts, plots, etc. It will showcase what R can do with a large dataset of a few hundred datapoints.
